# dps-cityworker - City Worker Career Simulation

A comprehensive career simulation resource for FiveM that transforms simple utility tasks into a fully managed city infrastructure system. Features strategic grid management, persistent world damage, and a player-run contractor economy.

## Features

- **Strategic Grid Management**: City is divided into managed sectors (Legion, Mirror Park, Sandy Shores) with dynamic health tracking.
- **Persistent Decay**: Infrastructure damage (potholes, broken lights) is saved to the database and worsens over time if neglected.
- **Contractor Economy**: Players can register utility companies and bid on government maintenance contracts.
- **Union Progression**: A 5-tier seniority system unlocking specialized equipment and pay grades.
- **Control Room UI**: Advanced dashboard for monitoring grid health and dispatching crews.
- **Traffic Control**: Functional props (cones, barriers) that actively reroute NPC traffic around work zones.
